This Python section has 2 different directories. The School one correspond to every Python exercise made as class homework, this directory is divided in different units each one with its exercises and exams (ejer: for exercises, POP: for exams). Some exercises use pycheck to autocorrect themselves, pycheck is a tool made by my teacher to autocorrect python exercises. You can check pycheck here: `https://pycheck.es/docs/`. The other directory are exercises I made by myself to practise a bit more.
